    History of Snowboarding
</h1>

    Snowboarding was first developed in 1965 <br> when Sherman Poppin strapped two skis together. <br> Poppins wife coined the term, 'Snurfing', which combined
    surfing and snow. <br>
    Since then, the snowboard and snowboarding <br> has been improved tremendously.
    Snowboarding is very popular <br> in the US and other countries like Switzerland, <br> France, Austria, and New Zealand.
    Some of my personal <br> favorite snowboarders are Luke Winkelman from North Carolina,<br> Chloe Kim from California, and Annika Morgan from Germany.
