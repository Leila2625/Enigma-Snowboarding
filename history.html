    History of Snowboarding
</h1>
 
<body>
    Snowboarding was first developed in 1965 when Sherman Poppin strapped two skis together. <br> Poppins wife coined the term, 'Snurfing', which combined
    surfing and snow. <br>
    Since then, the snowboard and snowboarding has been improved tremendously. <br>
    Snowboarding is very popular in the US and other countries like Switzerland, France, Austria, and New Zealand. <br>
    Some of my personal favorite snowboarders are Luke Winkelman from North Carolina,<br> Chloe Kim from California, and Annika Morgan from Germany.
