    <p style=text-align:right;">Snowboarding was first developed in 1965 when Sherman Poppin strapped two skis together.<br> Poppins wife coined the term,
                               'Snurfing', which combined
    surfing and snow.
    Since <br> then, the snowboard and snowboarding has been improved tremendously.<br> 
    Snowboarding is very popular in the US and other countries like Switzerland, <br> France, Austria, and New Zealand.
    Some of my personal <br> favorite snowboarders are Luke Winkelman from North Carolina, Chloe Kim <br> from California, and Annika Morgan from Germany.
