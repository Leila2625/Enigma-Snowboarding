    History of Snowboarding
</h1>
    
<body align right>
    Snowboarding was first developed in 1965 when Sherman Poppin strapped two skis together. Poppins wife coined the term, 'Snurfing', which combined
    surfing and snow.
    Since then, the snowboard and snowboarding has been improved tremendously.
    Snowboarding is very popular in the US and other countries like Switzerland, France, Austria, and New Zealand. 
    Some of my personal favorite snowboarders are Luke Winkelman from North Carolina, Chloe Kim from California, and Annika Morgan from Germany.
